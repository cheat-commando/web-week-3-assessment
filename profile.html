    <h3>Me in a nutshell</h3>
    <p>My name is Carston Work, and I am a thinker and problem-solver.</p>
    <p>
        I love understanding what is going on around me and discovering how things fit and work together, especially though trial and error. I have recently discovered immense enjoyment in coding, which fits in nicely with my other interests of game design and novel writing.
    </p>
    <p>
        I love spending time with my wife and kids. Seeing my children learn about the world around them and about their own abilities is one of the greatest joys of my life.
    </p>
