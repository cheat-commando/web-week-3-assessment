    <h1>Lindon</h1>

        Lindon is a small town wedged between Orem and Pleasant Grove.<br>It does not boast many fancy things, but it does have a Walmart and a Home Depot.<br><br>
        I would say that its crowing jewel is the Aquatics Center, located at 60 W 60 N, Lindon, UT 84042, right next to the community center. Lindon adult residents
        can get it for $4, but non-resident adults can enter for $5; the slight difference doesn't deter non-residents from joining in the fun. <br><br>

        Lindon does sport a few restaurants, though from the following list, I have only been to one: Los Hermanos.<br><br>
        Los Hermanos (meaning "The Brothers", or "The Siblings") is a Mexican-style restaurant located on the corner of 400 N and State St. 
        My wife particularly enjoys the pork chimichanga, while I like their fajitas and shrimp salad.
